    "In the facility location problem, the goal is to optimally place facilities so as to minimize transportation costs from the facilities to the customers. In practice, one rarely knows the demand of customers with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, the transportation costs themselves may vary with time and are subject to uncertainty. In this version of the facility location problem, we assume that all data is known.\n",

    "In the first part of this problem, the goal is to locate one or more facilities out of five possible sites, which we designated as $F_1,F_2,F_3,F_4$, and $F_5$. The cost of selecting a facility is \\$40. Coincidentally, there are also five customers that need to be serviced. We refer to them as $C_1,C_2,C_3,C_4$ and $C_5$. The delivery cost from each possible facility site to each of the five customers is known. The cost of satisfying (all of) the demand of Customer $C_j$ from site $F_i$ is $d_{ij}$. (Note that the first index is for the site and the second is for the customer.) The delivery cost from all possible sites to all customers are given in Table 1 below.\n",
